## Machine-Learning-Prediction-Project

### Objective 

The purpose of the project was to train the model on traning data, and validate it using validation data to 
predict the class (which is 'classe' variable in training data set) or type of excercise performed by 6 participants. 

The training and test data sets can be found from the following links

And, finally apply the accurate model on test data set to predict the type of excercise outcome.


### Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. 
These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to 
improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. 
One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely 
quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm,
 arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
